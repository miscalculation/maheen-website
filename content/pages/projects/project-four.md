  How do restaurants that are most frequented by college students in the three
  major college cities in Metro Detroit stack up against a college town like New
  York, NY?University students love restaurants. Whether they’re too busy
  studying to cook dinner or have burnt the family’s ravioli recipe in their
  kitchens--restaurants have become one of the saving graces of a busy college
  student. Nearly half of college students dine off campus every day, with
  almost 58% visiting a quick-service restaurant and 57% going to a coffee shop
  once a1 week or more often.​What I’ve set out to do is explore the restaurant
  scene in Michigan, and compare it to a city like New York. The locations
  chosen were based on my personal experience of attending schools in two cities
  (Wayne State University in Detroit and the University of Michigan in Ann
  Arbor) and frequently visiting Michigan State University in Lansing. It would
  be an interesting comparison to see how Metro Detroit restaurants measure up
  to the diverse restaurant scene in New York City. These conclusions are my
  own, but can provide some insight into the best food college cities in
  Michigan can provide.DataThe data for the restaurants were pulled from the
  Yelp API, through multiple API calls to the cities that surround the
  universities in Michigan: Wayne State University is represented by Detroit;
  University of Michigan is represented by Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti; and Michigan
  State University is represented by East Lansing and Lansing.The map below
  shows the 836 restaurants in Detroit. Downtown Detroit and Midtown are more
  populated.
