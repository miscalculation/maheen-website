The Opportunity Atlas uses anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-thirties. It gives data on how much kids who grew up in certain neighborhoods earn as adults.

Stanford University researchers found that almost half of parental income advantages in the United States are passed on to children. The research also found that a family's economic circumstances play an important role in determining a child's economic prospects. Children raised in families in the 90th percentile for household income can expect their own family income to be three times higher than children raised at the 10th percentile for household income.

According to the American Community Survey, 1 in 3 American Indians are living in poverty--with a median income of $23,000 a year. The findings at Stanford show that children raised in families that are "far apart on the income ladder can expect very different economic futures". Using the data from the Opportunity Atlas, we will be able to determine if the statement holds true with American Indians in the United States.
